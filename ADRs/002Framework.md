# Framework

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The idea was floated out to assemble a PHP application from the ground up, but influencing factors included authentication, collaboration, and efficiency of development

## Decision

We found that Meteor, a JS framework, satisfied all of these conditions

## Consequences

Simplicity of writing primarily in one language
Speed of development process via framework vs. full development
