# Infrastructure

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We had a choice of running the application on a Virtual Machine or by using Docker containers

## Decision

The application will run with Docker

## Consequences

It better aligns with the curriculum of the class
We found documentation that helps easily create a Docker image from a Meteor application
It still takes some time to set up and we are learning as we go
